## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to find number of years based on principle,rate & simple interest.

## Algorithm
1.Analyze the question
2.Follow the algorithm
3.Try the code
4.Check for error
5.Run & Display the output


## Program:
```
/*

RegisterNumber:  
*/
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float principal, rate, simple_interest, time;

    scanf("%f", &principal);
    scanf("%f", &rate);
    scanf("%f", &simple_interest);

    // Calculate time (years)
    time = (simple_interest * 100) / (principal * rate);

    printf("Number of years = %.2f\n", time);

    return 0;
}

## Output:
1000
5
250
Number of years = 5.00

## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
